# Cloud Computing
### What is it?
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services - including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence - over the Internet. It offers faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. You typically pay only for cloud services you use, helping to lower operating costs, run infrastructure more efficiently, and scale as businesses need change.

Cloud computing is on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS).

### What are its benefits?
Agility
The cloud gives you easy access to a broad range of technologies so that you can innovate faster and build nearly anything that you can imagine. You can quickly spin up resources as you need themâ€“from infrastructure services, such as compute, storage, and databases, to Internet of Things, machine learning, data lakes and analytics, and much more.
Deploy technology services in a matter of minutes
Elasticity
With cloud computing, you don't have to over provision resources up.
Instead, you can provision the amount of resources that you actually need, scale the resources up or down to instantly grow or shrink capacity
Cost
The cloud allows you to trade fixed expenses (such as data centers and physical servers) for variable expenses, and only pay for IT as you consume it. Variable expenses are much lower than what you would pay to do it yourself.
Deploy globally
With the cloud, you can expand to a new geographic regions and deploy within minutes, just with a few clicks.


### PAAS, SAAS, IAAS
Three main types of cloud computing include Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service, and Software as a Service. Each type of cloud computing provides different levels of control, flexibilty, and management so that you can select the right set of services for your needs.

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Infrastructure as a service, is on-demand access to cloud-hosted physical and virtual servers, storage and networking - the backend IT infrastructure for running applications and workloads in the cloud.

Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Platform as a service, is on-demand access to a complete, ready-to-use, cloud-hosted platform for developing, running, maintaining and managing applications.

Software as a Service (SaaS)
- Software as a service, is on-demand access to ready-to-use, cloud-hosted application software.
